## My Work 

Currently, my work focuses on implementing adaptive learning techniques in stochastic continuous-time models. 

This setting advantageous as the solution algorithms for these models is fast and yields detailed information about the distribution of key variables. 

## Works in Progress

### Linear Quadratic Methods in Continuous-Time (In progress) 
The linear quadratic framework allows for large and complex models of the macroeconomy. 
This framework has been studied extensively in discrete-time, yet very few papers have explored the continuous-time analogs. 
I recast the traditional linear quadratic regulator problem in continuous-time and outline solution methods for the dynamic programming problem. 
I also show that under certain variable transforms and small time intervals, a discrete-time system in this setting will converge to the same solutions as the continuous-time system. 
Most importantly, I examine adaptive rules in this setting and find convergence to rational expectations equilibria under learning rules with exact discrete data. 

### Adaptive Learning in a Continuous-Time Setting: Representative Agent Exercises 
I examine simple Ramsey models in both discrete and continuous-time settings, 
then using exact discrete time models that depend on time intervals I demonstrate that the discrete models limit to the continuous-time models.
The majority of this paper focuses on stylized learning rules in the continuous-time setting. 
These stylized learning rules involve updating parameters, but no direct feedback from the model itself.
