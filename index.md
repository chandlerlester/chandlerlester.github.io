I am an economist whose research focuses on developing adaptive learning techniques for use in continuous-time macroeconomic models and on data frequency's impact on decision making and expectations.

I have taken a placement with the Macroeconomic Analysis Division of the Congressional Budget Office starting Summer 2021. 

Areas of interest: continuous-time macroeconomics, adaptive learning, and computational methods.
