## Getting Started 

I already owned my domain name: <http://chandlerlester.com> via google domains. 

*  Create a special github repository.  
    + It needs the following naming format: username.github.io  
    + Note: this process will be a little simpler if your username is the same as your desired domain name. 


## Settings (on Github)

There are several important settings you need to change to host your domain through github. 

     1. Change the following under settings in Github (above the Danger Zone)

## Customization 

There are a lot of Jeykll themes for github pages. Many people create these themes for free.

## How Did I Personalize My Site? 

    1. I forked the Minimal Mistakes repo 
    
    2. Then I followed the online tutorial for some basic edits  
    
    3. Since I am obsessed with customization, I made a lot of other changes 
  + [Look at how many commits I have!](https://github.com/chandlerlester/chandlerlester.github.io)
    
## How Customizable are these Sites? 

Grant's website is also built on Minimal Mistakes, see how different [his](http://grantmcdermott.com) site from [mine](http://chandlerlester.com)! 

These designer's constantly update themes, and they all have a lot of customizable settings. 

## Let's Play Around with Some of the Basic Settings
