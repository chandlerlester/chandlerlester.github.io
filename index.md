I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at the University of Oregon. My dissertation focuses on developing adaptive learning techniques for use in continuous-time macroeconomic models and on data frequency's impact on decision making and expectations.

Other projects of mine focus on predicting bank failures using machine learning and big data. 

Areas of interest: continuous-time macroeconomics, adaptive learning, and computational methods.
