## My Work 

<font size="2">My work focuses on implementing adaptive learning techniques in stochastic continuous-time models. 

This setting advantageous as the solution algorithms for these models is fast and yields detailed information about the distribution of key variables. </font>

## Works in Progress

### Boundedly Rational Decision Making in Continuous-Time (In progress) 
<font size="2">Continuous-time macroeconomic literature has expanded greatly in recentyears. Modeling in this framework allows for the combination of classic macroeonomic and financial asset modeling techniques. As work on continuous-time models becomes more prevalent macroeconomists will have to adapt essential discrete-time methods to continuous-time. The aim of this paper is to modify adaptive learning techniques to continuous-time. One approach to accomplish this  task,  is  to  begin  with  shadow-price  learning  (SP-learning) a framework in  which  agents  forecast  their  expected  shadow  prices. In  order  to  use  this framework, I first need a tractable continuous-time linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem. While discrete-time LQR problems are common in economics literature, there is very little work on continuous-time LQR problems. Thus, the contributions of this work are two-fold. I build a continuous-time LQR framework  for  solving  Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmanâ€™s  (HJBs) using iterative methods and implement adaptive learning techniques in this new framework.</font>

### Adaptive Learning in a Continuous-Time Setting: Representative Agent Exercises 
<font size="2">I examine simple Ramsey models in both discrete and continuous-time settings, 
then using exact discrete time models that depend on time intervals I demonstrate that the discrete models limit to the continuous-time models.
The majority of this paper focuses on stylized learning rules in the continuous-time setting. 
These stylized learning rules involve updating parameters, but no direct feedback from the model itself.</font>
